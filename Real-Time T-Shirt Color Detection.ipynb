    "## Project Description\n",
    "This project aims to develop a real-time T-shirt color detection system using the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8) object detection model. The system will capture frames from a webcam feed, process them using the YOLOv8 model, and identify the color of T-shirts worn by individuals in the frame. The detected colors will be displayed with bounding boxes around the T-shirts in real-time."

    "## Objectives\n",
    "- **Real-Time Webcam Feed Integration:** Capture video feed from the webcam and process each frame to detect T-shirt colors in real-time.\n",
    "- **YOLOv8 Model for Object Detection:** Utilize the YOLOv8 model, which is known for its high speed and accuracy in object detection tasks.\n",
    "- **Color Detection:** Detect and classify T-shirt colors into predefined categories such as black, blue, grey, and white.\n",
    "- **Bounding Box Visualization:** Draw bounding boxes around detected T-shirts with labels indicating the identified color and confidence score."

    "## Tools and Technologies\n",
    "1. **YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8)**\n",
    "- **Why YOLOv8?** YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art object detection model that offers a good balance between speed and accuracy, making it ideal for real-time applications.\n",
    "- **Usage:** YOLOv8 will be used to detect T-shirts and classify their colors from the captured webcam frames.\n",
    "2. **OpenCV**\n",
    "- **Why OpenCV?** OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is a powerful library for computer vision tasks. It is used for image processing, video capture, and analysis.\n",
    "- **Usage:** OpenCV will be used to handle the webcam feed, preprocess images, and draw bounding boxes on detected objects.\n",
    "3. **Google Colab**\n",
    "- **Why Google Colab?** Google Colab provides a free cloud-based environment with GPU support, making it convenient for developing and testing deep learning models.\n",
    "- **Usage:** Google Colab will be used to run the notebook and perform the computations required for real-time T-shirt color detection.\n"

    "## Implementation Steps\n",
    "- **Install Required Packages:** Ensure all necessary libraries are installed in the Colab environment.\n",
    "- **Load the YOLOv8 Model:** Load a pre-trained YOLOv8 model fine-tuned for T-shirt color detection.\n",
    "- **Capture Webcam Feed:** Integrate webcam feed using JavaScript and OpenCV to capture frames in real-time.\n",
    "- **Preprocess Frames:** Convert the captured frames to the required format for the YOLOv8 model.\n",
    "- **Detect T-shirt Colors:** Use the YOLOv8 model to detect and classify T-shirt colors in each frame.\n",
    "- **Visualize Results:** Draw bounding boxes around detected T-shirts with labels indicating the color and confidence score.\n",
    "- **Display Output:** Show the processed frames with bounding boxes in the notebook."

    "## Expected Outcome\n",
    "By the end of this project, we will have a functional system that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Capture real-time video feed from a webcam.\n",
    "- Detect T-shirts in the video feed.\n",
    "- Classify the detected T-shirts into predefined color categories.\n",
    "- Display the results with bounding boxes and labels indicating the detected colors.\n",
